# live-earnings Worker

Pushes the money figure to the app's live-earnings Live Activity, once a minute,
for the life of a session.

## Why this exists

A Live Activity repaints only its **time-derived** views on its own: the elapsed
clock and the progress bar are drawn by iOS from two dates and move with no help
from anyone. The money figure is a plain string, frozen at whatever the last
update carried. On the Lock Screen the app is suspended and cannot run code, so
the only thing left that can move that string is an ActivityKit push.

That is the whole feature. Everything below is plumbing for it.

An ActivityKit push is **not a notification**: no banner, no sound, nothing in
Notification Center, and — the part that makes this acceptable to ship — it
requires **no notification permission at all**. Live Activity delivery is
independent of an app's notification settings, so this works for users who have
denied notifications outright.

## Shape

```
POST /live-earnings/register     { appUserId, pushToken, environment, startedAt, endsAt, hourlyRate, currencySymbol }
POST /live-earnings/unregister   { appUserId, pushToken? }
GET  /health                     { ok, configured }
cron * * * * *                   push every running session, prune the rest
```

`register` is an upsert keyed by the push token, so the app can call it freely:
that one call covers first registration, repair after being offline, and a token
ActivityKit rotated mid-session.

In practice the first call happens on the app's **first transition out of the
foreground**, not when the clock starts. ActivityKit mints the token per
activity and asynchronously, so `Activity.request()` returns before it exists -
measured on a simulator it is still nil seconds later, on an install that has
run sessions before. An early version waited for it and bought nothing but a
Start button that stalled. Leaving the app is the moment before the Lock Screen
is looked at anyway, so nothing is lost.

`unregister` without a token drops every card for the account, which is what a
sign-out wants.

## What the cron does

For each row still running it computes the amount from `(started_at,
hourly_rate)` — money accrues linearly, so the figure at any instant is
arithmetic — and pushes it, unless the formatted figure is identical to the last
one pushed. That skip matters: late in a long session at a modest rate the
amount only changes every few minutes, and each push not sent is one left in
Apple's delivery budget.

A session past its end gets one final `end` event and its row is dropped. A
token APNs rejects as dead (`Unregistered`, `BadDeviceToken`) is dropped
immediately; anything transient (429, 5xx, a rejected provider token) leaves the
row for the next minute.

**The amount is formatted here, not sent from the app.** It has to be, because
the app is asleep — but it also has to match, because the app formats the figure
it pushes on foreground and a user must never see the number change shape
depending on which one got there last. `src/earnings.ts` is a deliberate port of
the app's own helpers, and `__tests__/services/liveEarningsPushContract.test.ts`
in the app imports both sides and fails if they drift.

## Configuration

`APNS_BUNDLE_ID` is a plain var in `wrangler.toml` (the Worker appends the
`.push-type.liveactivity` topic suffix itself). The rest are **secrets**, added
in the dashboard under Settings → Variables and Secrets:

| Secret                           | Where it comes from                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `APNS_KEY_ID`                    | Key ID of the APNs auth key (Apple Developer → Keys)         |
| `APNS_TEAM_ID`                   | Apple Developer Team ID                                      |
| `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY`               | Contents of the `.p8`, PEM, BEGIN/END lines included         |
| `MONEY2TIME_REQUEST_SIGNING_KEY` | Same value as the app's `EXPO_PUBLIC_REQUEST_SIGNING_KEY`    |

The APNs key must be enabled for **Apple Push Notifications service**; one key
serves every app on the team, and the same key works for both gateways.

Until those are set the Worker still accepts registrations and simply does not
push — `GET /health` reports `configured: false`, and each cron tick logs that it
skipped. That is deliberate: a half-configured deploy leaves cards frozen (which
is the old behaviour) rather than dropping sessions on the floor.

## Sandbox vs production

A push token minted by a development build is rejected outright by the
production gateway, and vice versa. The app states which kind of build it is at
registration (`environment`) rather than leaving the Worker to guess or to try
both — so a debug build on a device pushes through `api.sandbox.push.apple.com`
and a TestFlight/App Store build through `api.push.apple.com`.

## Local

```bash
npm run dev        # wrangler dev
npm run typecheck
```

The interesting logic is covered by the **app's** test suite rather than a
runner here — `__tests__/services/liveEarnings{PushContract,Apns,Cron}.test.ts`
import these modules directly, including a real P-256 key to verify the ES256
provider token end to end.
